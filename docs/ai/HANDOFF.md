# AI Handoff — Travel Concierge

## Last change
Enriched whyPick evidence quality by promoting venue-specific Foursquare tags, Tavily award signals, and Yelp "known for" patterns to structured differentiators (branch: claude/verify-whypick-pipeline-73XFm).

## Files touched
- `backend/app/concierge/evidence.py` — core evidence enrichment
- `backend/tests/test_evidence_normalization.py` — 8 new tests
- `backend/tests/test_whypick_differentiators.py` — 2 updated assertions, 8 new tests

## Behavior change
**Foursquare tag specificity filter** (`_foursquare_tag_is_specific`):
- Tags like "handmade tortillas", "craft cocktails", "zero-waste", "omakase" → `safe_for_copy=True`, `confidence=medium`
- Tags like "trendy", "date-night", "casual" → remain `safe_for_copy=False`
- Effect: venues with only Foursquare tags now surface as differentiators in `select_differentiators()` and reach the LLM prompt as anchors

**Tavily award extraction** (`_AWARD_SIGNAL_RE`):
- Tavily snippets mentioning Michelin stars, James Beard, award-winning → promote an `attribute` unit with `safe_for_copy=True`
- Enables LLM to anchor whyPick on awards even when no Michelin status was supplied explicitly

**Yelp "known for" extraction** (`_KNOWN_FOR_RE`):
- Yelp review excerpts with "known for X", "celebrated for X", "acclaimed for X" → promote an `attribute` unit with `safe_for_copy=True`
- Enables extraction of signature item signals from user reviews

**Before / After examples:**

| Venue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Kumiko (FS tags only, no editorial) | "A cocktail bar in West Loop, a reliable spot for evening drinks." | "Kumiko is a cocktail bar in West Loop known for japanese-inspired cocktails." |
| Mas Maiz (FS tags) | "Mas Maiz is a Mexican restaurant in Capitol Hill..." (rating fallback) | "Mas Maiz is a Mexican restaurant in Capitol Hill known for handmade tortillas." |

## Known issues
- LLM path still requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to be set; deterministic path is the active path in all test runs
- Foursquare tag content is lowercased in the deterministic copy builder (`specialty_tags[0].lower()`); proper-noun tags like "Japanese" become lowercase
- foursquare_category units remain `safe_for_copy=False` (category labels are not differentiators)

## Next likely task
- Fix lowercasing of specialty tag copy in `reasoning.py` (`_build_nightlife_display_why` / `_build_cuisine_restaurant_display_why`)
- Validate that real-world Foursquare tags returned by live API are specific enough to pass the filter (audit production data)
- Consider surfacing yelp_review_excerpt "known for" extraction also from editorial `source_reason` text for secondary attribute units

## Debug notes
- Test suite: 112 tests, 0 failures as of this change
- `_foursquare_tag_is_specific()` in `evidence.py:46` controls the promotion logic; extend `_GENERIC_FS_TAGS` if new generic tags appear in production
- Award regex: `_AWARD_SIGNAL_RE` in `evidence.py:74`; handles "Michelin stars" (plural) and "James Beard" variants
- All new evidence units preserve the `venue_name` anti-contamination field
